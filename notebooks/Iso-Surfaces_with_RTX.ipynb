    "# Single-Node Rendering of a Numpy Array in ParaView\n",
    "There are a ton of great visualization frameworks out there for Jupyter and iPython. Most of these work by importing data from the python kernel on the server back to the client to be visualized with Javascript. This has proven to be a very capable and flexible approach, but it's not without its drawbacks. As your data size grows, the cost to transfer between server and client becomes prohibitive--and that's if your client machine can even handle the data size to begin with. Usually, data in this category is aggregated or decimated in some way before visualization. But, if you happen to be working on a server with a big, beefy GPU, wouldn't it be nice to be able to just render the data where it lives?\n",
    "\n",
    "Server-side remote rendering, both single- and multi-node, has been standard practice in the scientific simulation community for years, supported by a set of feature-rich tools. This project brings one of the most popular scientific visualization packages, ParaView, into the Jupyter notebook.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll work with a CT scan of a human head for our example. We'll first download it from a public source, then load it into memory using numpy. Since the data is in a raw binary format, we have to know the format ahead of time--16-bit unsigned integer, big-endian, and 256x256x113 grid dimensions. Once we have the data in a numpy array, we can use VTK's built-in numpy support to wrap the array in a vtkImageData object."

The RenderView object serves as our window onto the data, and is also the way we change the resolution, camera position, etc. Finally, we add a \"Contour\" filter to ParaView's pipeline.
