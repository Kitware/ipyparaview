    "# Multi-Node Rendering with Dask-MPI and Dask.Array\n",
    "If you looked at the Array.ipynb example, you saw server-side rendering driven by Jupyter's python kernel, but we can also drive the renderer with Dask. What's more, we can use a cluster of Dask-MPI workers to distribute the rendering across multiple GPUs, or even multiple nodes. It takes a little more setup than the single-node, Jupyter driven case but, with large enough data, sometimes you just want to be able to to throw hardware at the problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we get started, we'll need a running Dask-MPI cluster. The scheduler process and worker processes are launched via separate `mpiexec`/`mpirun` calls--the Dask scheduler doesn't participate as a worker, which means that one of our ranks would be missing from `COMM_WORLD` if we launched the scheduler and workers together. The root project directory contains a script which demonstrates the syntax for launching a dask-mpi cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once the cluster is ready, our next step is to connect to the Dask scheduler from the Jupyter client. Here we're using a description file (`scheduler.json`) output by the scheduler process at startup, but you could just as easily connect to it via URL."

Note the `range(N)` (`N` is the number of workers in our cluster) in the call, which makes sure that Dask spawns the one task/worker that we want. `client.map` just returns futures, so we need to gather the results back to the Jupyter kernel in order to work with them.
